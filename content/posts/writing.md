[notes on a worldview](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2020-12/seminal-ideas-and-more), the seminal influences that have made me who i am

<br />

[what i've spent my whole life trying to put into words](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2020-11/putting-into-words), and i’m still looking for the words to say the things i mean; someday soon, i may find them.

[the last time the internet was the only place that mattered to us](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2020-11/only-the-internet-matters), and how it reminds you of another time in your life when online was the only thing that mattered.

[tell me something i don't know](https://reading.supply/@kelly/tell-me-something-i-dont-already-know-hGzs5s), the things i keep writing the same versions of.

[happy, free, confused, and lonely (in the best way)](https://blog.kellyluo.me/2020-12/how-old-are-we-really), on turning twenty-two in the worst year in memory.

[all of a sudden i miss everyone](https://blog.kellyluo.me/articles/2020-05/all-of-a-sudden-i-miss-everyone) on leaving campus in march through graduating in may. the most emotionally difficult thing i've ever tried to write.
